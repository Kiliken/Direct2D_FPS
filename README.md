# Direct2D Raycaster
A simple, educational raycasting engine implemented using **Microsoft** [**Direct2D**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/direct2d/direct2d-portal) for 2D rendering and [**SDL 3**](https://www.libsdl.org/) for window management and input handling.

This project is a direct implementation of the classic raycasting technique used in games like Wolfenstein 3D, demonstrating how a 3D environment can be rendered using only 2D APIs.
